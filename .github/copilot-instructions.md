# FreshBytes Frontend



 
 - **Component Structure:**
	 Use the `components/` directory for reusable UI components. Organize by feature (e.g., `products/`, `users/`).
 
 - **Composables:**
	 Place reusable logic in the `composables/` directory. Use TypeScript for type safety.
 
 - **API Layer:**
	 Centralize API calls in `plugins/axios.ts` or a dedicated `services/` directory. Always handle errors gracefully.
 
 - **State Management:**
	 Use Pinia stores in the `stores/` directory. Keep state logic modular and avoid storing UI state globally.
 
 - **Authentication:**
	 Store JWT securely (preferably in HttpOnly cookies). Use Nuxt middleware for route protection.
 
 - **Type Safety:**
	 Use TypeScript interfaces for API responses, store state, and props.
 
 - **Linting & Formatting:**
	 Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style. Add rules to enforce best practices.
 
 - **Testing:**
	 Add unit and integration tests for critical logic and components.
 
 - **Accessibility:**
	 Ensure all UI components are accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
 
 - **Performance:**
	 Use lazy loading for routes and components. Optimize images and assets.
 
 - **Documentation:**
	 Document composables, stores, and complex components with JSDoc or TypeScript comments.

 - **KISS Principle:**
	 Always follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principleâ€”prefer simple, clear solutions over complex ones.
